Awkwardness is what you feel if you do not know what a socially
acceptable (re)action is (and you're aware of this fact and desire to
be socially acceptable).

Awkwardness is often caused by someone breaking a social convention;
social conventions often exist to give us a restricted framework of
permissible actions.  This allows us to better predict how others will
react.
