[Positive] Teasing is playful banter.

To quote Jane McGonigal from ``Reality is Broken'':

> Teasing each other, recent scientific research has shown, is one of the
> fastest and most effective ways to intensify our positive feelings for each
> other.  Dacher Keltner, a leading researcher of prosocial emotions at the
> University of California, has conducted experiments on the psychological
> benefits of teasing, and he believes that teasing plays an invaluable role in
> helping us form and maintain positive relationships.
>
> ``The tease is like a social vaccine,'' Keltner explains. ``It stimulates the
> recipient's emotional system.'' Teasingly trash-talking allows us to provoke
> each other's negative emotions in a very mild way---we stimulate a very small
> amount of anger or hurt or embarrassment. This tiny provocation has two
> powerful effects. First, it confirms trust: the person doing the teasing is
> demonstrating the capacity to hurt, but simultaneously showing that the
> intention is not to hurt. Just like a dog might play-bite another dog to show
> that it wants to be friends, we bare our teeth to each other in order to
> remind each other that we could, but never really would, hurt each other.
> Conversely, by allowing someone else to tease us, we confirm our willingness
> to be in a vulnerable position. We are actively demonstrating our trust in the
> other person's regard for our emotional well-being.
