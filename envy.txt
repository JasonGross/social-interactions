When you desire something, and you see someone else have/achieve/obtain it, you
tend to feel one of two things: either you feel inspired, because seeing
someone accomplish that makes you more sure that you can accomplish it
yourself, or you feel put down, because seeing that person accomplish it makes
you more convinced that you could never do the same. (Alternatively, you might
be indifferent, but that's a boring case.) In the latter case, if you further
feel that you can't accomplish/obtain that for some reason other than your own
choice, then you feel envious/jealous/resentful (perhaps even in addition to
feeling happy for the person). There are three primary ways to deal with this:
you can learn to stop desiring the thing (~equivalently, make it your own
choice that you're not accomplishing/obtaining it), you can grow accustomed to
the desire/envy so that it doesn't affect your actions, or you can learn to put
it out of your mind and focus on other things, so that it usually doesn't
affect your life. I'd guess that most people choose the third way, because it's
probably the easiest. If you do choose this way, then you will probably
continue to feel the jealousy more strongly whenever you see a person with that
thing/achievement.
