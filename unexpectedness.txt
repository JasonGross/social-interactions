It seems to me that some people prefer people to be unexpected or
unpredictable in relationships.  (Consider the criticism "you're too
predictable" or "you're too boring".)  I think I have an explanation
for this:


When we observe something, we always observe it relative to our
subconscious expectations.  Similarly, when we judge something to be
positive or negative, we naturally judge it relative to our
subconscious expectations.  If something is exactly what we expect,
we're not going to think that it's positive or negative; we're not
going to notice it at all.  (How often do you consciously notice that
people don't spontaneously dissolve?  Of course, spontaneous
dissolution would be terrible, but that's because we're considering it
relative to our very strong expectation that it doesn't happen.  If
someone said "isn't it great that we don't spontaneously dissolve?!",
you'd look at that person weirdly and wonder what made them think of
that.)

If we want to appreciate something that we find expected/typical
(something we take for granted), we try to find ways to make the
typical be unexpected, (rather than manipulating our emotional state
or our perception of the situation directly).

So if something is exactly what we subconsciously expect, we won't
find it beautiful, and we won't appreciate it unless we make an effort
to find it unexpected.
