I find that the hardest part of making friends isn't the walking up and saying
hi, nor the getting to know each other well enough to exchange emails and know
each others' names, but to move past the acquaintances stage and get someone to
actually notice you and decide that you're worth spending time with.  I think
the quick-deep-bonds form when you get past that stage within the first few
interactions.

This is because you have a certain amount of social currency with strangers.
Taking up someone's time costs social currency.  If you eat through all your
social currency without getting them interested enough in you to give you more,
then you start coming off as creepy (see creepiness.txt).
