I find that the hardest part of making friends isn't the walking up and saying
hi, nor the getting to know each other well enough to exchange emails and know
each others' names, but to move past the acquaintances stage and get someone to
actually notice you and decide that you're worth spending time with.  I think
the quick-deep-bonds form when you get past that stage within the first few
interactions.
