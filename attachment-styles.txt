Attachment styles are described in "Attached: The New Science of Adult
Attachment and How It Can Help You Find - and Keep - Love" by Amir

Anxious-preoccupied fears loss of connection
Avoidant-dismissive fears loss of autonomy
Anxious-avoidant / disorganized fears loss of both
Secure fears loss of neither


Anxious-preoccupied reacts to hardship/conflict by seeking to reaffirm
  connection. "I need you to be here for me; are you here for me?"

Avoidant-dismissive reacts to hardship/conflict by seeking to affirm
  autonomy. "I need you to give me space; can you give me space?"

Anxious-avoidant/disorganized seeks to affirm both, or each
  alternatively. I've heard that the experience is like "come no
  closer than here and go no further than there".

Secure doesn't feel the need to have either connection nor autonomy
  affirmed in order to feel safe engaging with conflict/hardship.
